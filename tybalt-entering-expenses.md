# Entering Expenses

>users require the 'time' claim in their Profile to enter expenses

In addition to time, Tybalt also tracks expenses incurred by staff. Previously, staff would record expenses on their Timesheets, which were Excel spreadsheets, and send them to a central email address where each expense was manually verified. The expenses were subsequently collated to create a payables report and then sent to payroll where employees could be reimbursed based on the content. Tybalt improves every part of this process. Here's how that works.

## 1. Expenses

Expenses are complete records of money being spent in the line of work. They can be broadly categorized into one of four payment types:

* Expense (an employee's own money was spent and they are requesting reimbursement)
* Personal Mileage (an employee's own vehicle was driven and they are requesting reimbursement)
* Fuel Card (a company-issued fuel card was used to purchase fuel for a company vehicle and the employee is fulfilling their obligation to submit the receipt)
* Corporate Visa (a corporate credit card was used to puchase goods or services required in the line of work and the employee is fulfilling their obligation to submit the receipt)

Validations are run on each expense every time they're saved helping to minimize errors. Depending on the payment type you have selected, the fields available for completion change.

## 2. Submitting an Expense

You may submit an expense at any time after it is created. In Tybalt, expenses are independent of time sheets (and in fact pay periods). The approval process of an expense determines the pay period in which reimbursable expenses will be paid. An expense is submitted by clicking the submit ![Submit](https://github.com/stamler/tbte-docs/blob/master/tybalt-images/submitIcon.png) icon. When you submit an expense, the manager set in your settings will receive the expense in their pending expenses list so that they may approve or reject it. You can change your manager in settings as required. If you change your manager you'll be logged out so the settings take effect. You only need to set your manager once unless your reporting manager changes.

After your expense has been approved by your manager, it must be *committed*. This is the process of locking an expense so that no further changes are possible, and then allowing accounting to act on it (reimbursement or recording it in the ledger). Up to the point that an expense is committed it may be rejected by the approving managerâ€” even if it is already approved. Similarly up to the point that an expense is approved by your manager, you may recall it. You do this by clicking the recall ![Recall](https://github.com/stamler/tbte-docs/blob/master/tybalt-images/recall.png) icon. Once an expense is approved (and prior to being committed), you may request your manager reject it so that it may be edited if you discover you've made an error.

Managers who approve their own expenses *are required* to manually approve their expenses after they've submitted them to themselves.

## 4. If Your Expense Is Rejected

Your manager may choose to reject your expense for a variety of reasons. If a manager elects to reject an expense, they must provide you a reason. You will see this rejection reason and it will help you to make the necessary changes. If your expense was rejected, read the reason then recall ![Recall](https://github.com/stamler/tbte-docs/blob/master/tybalt-images/recall.png) the expense and edit ![Edit](https://github.com/stamler/tbte-docs/blob/master/tybalt-images/editIcon.png) it. The expense will no longer show the rejection reason once it has been edited and you can resubmit ![Submit](https://github.com/stamler/tbte-docs/blob/master/tybalt-images/submitIcon.png) your expense for approval a second time.
