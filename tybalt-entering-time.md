# Entering Time

>users require the 'time' claim in their Profile to enter time

Most staff will use Tybalt for entering their time worked. Previously, staff had to create time sheets manually on an Excel spreadsheet and send them to a central email address where each entry was manually verified. The time sheet entries were subsequently collated to create an invoicing report and then sent to payroll where employees could be paid based on the content. Tybalt improves every part of this process. Here's how that works.

## 1. Time Entries

</p>

Time entries are the most basic unit of time. They contain a single description of an event that an employee worked on. Validations are run on each time entry every time they're saved helping to minimize errors. Think of time entries as individual rows of the old time sheet system. Tybalt introduces some benefits. You can set a default division so it is automatically selected each time you make a time entry. Job numbers can only be entered if they already exist in Tybalt. This ensures that you aren't accidentally making up jobs that don't exist! Fields that aren't allowed for a given time type are hidden when you select that time type. For example, if you've selected PPTO you won't be able to enter job hours. More checks will be added in the future to speed your workflow.

## 2. Submitting a Time Sheet

Time sheets are not manually created. Instead, at the end of a week when you've created all of your time entries, you submit them to your manager and they're bundled into a time sheet by clicking the submit ![Submit](https://github.com/stamler/tbte-docs/blob/master/tybalt-images/submitIcon.png) icon. Do not submit your timesheet until it is complete! You choose your manager in settings in the same way you choose your default division. If you change your manager you'll be logged out so the settings take effect. You only need to set your manager once unless your reporting manager changes. There can only be one time sheet for a given week so if you need to edit a time sheet, you must unbundle it (by clicking the Edit ![Edit](https://github.com/stamler/tbte-docs/blob/master/tybalt-images/editIcon.png) icon), edit ![Edit](https://github.com/stamler/tbte-docs/blob/master/tybalt-images/editIcon.png) or delete ![Delete](https://github.com/stamler/tbte-docs/blob/master/tybalt-images/deleteIcon.png) the entry or add others, then resubmit it. This process exists because validations are done on a time sheet *as a whole* during the submission process. For example, if you've tried to bank overtime but that brings your total below 44 hours, the bundling step will fail. There are many other checks that are performed during the bundling process.

If you submit your time sheet and then realize you've made a mistake, as long as your manager hasn't already approved it, you can recall it. You do this by clicking the rewind ![Recall](https://github.com/stamler/tbte-docs/blob/master/tybalt-images/recall.png) icon. If your manager has already approved it and administration hasn't already locked the time sheet for running payroll and invoicing, you can ask your manager to reject the time sheet. Once this is done you must recall the rejected time sheet and unbundle it then bundle it again before it can be resubmitted to your manager. If your time sheet was approved and locked and you later discover there were errors or omissions, you must submit a manual amendment request on a spreadsheet. Amendments are entered by administrators and because of their retroactive nature are represented in reports for the week they were entered rather than for the week the time was accrued in.

## 4. If Your Time Sheet Is Rejected

Your manager may choose to reject your time sheet for a variety of reasons. If a manager elects to reject a time sheet, they must provide you a reason. You will see this rejection reason and it will help them make the necessary changes. If your time sheet was rejected, read the reason then recall ![Recall](https://github.com/stamler/tbte-docs/blob/master/tybalt-images/recall.png) the time sheet and unbundle ![Edit](https://github.com/stamler/tbte-docs/blob/master/tybalt-images/editIcon.png) it. The time entries will once again be visible and you can make changes to individual entries, delete entries, or add new entries as necessary based on the instructions in the rejection. Finally you can bundle ![Bundle](https://github.com/stamler/tbte-docs/blob/master/tybalt-images/bundleIcon.png) the entries again and submit ![Submit](https://github.com/stamler/tbte-docs/blob/master/tybalt-images/submitIcon.png) your time sheet for approval a second time.
