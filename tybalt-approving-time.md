# Approving time

>users require the 'tapr' claim in their Profile to approve time

After a staff member has submitted a time sheet, the manager they have selected in their settings will be required to approve it. Managers can access time sheets that are pending approval from the *pending* tab at the top of the time sheets section of the app. Managers can either approve ![Approve](https://github.com/stamler/tbte-docs/blob/master/tybalt-images/checkIcon.png) or reject ![Reject](https://github.com/stamler/tbte-docs/blob/master/tybalt-images/deleteIcon.png) each timesheet. Of course an approving manager must verify the contents of the time sheet prior to approving or rejecting it. An approving manager can view a time sheet by clicking its date, which is linked to a details view.

## Some reasons to reject a time sheet

* A time sheet was submitted to you by a person who doesn't report to you
* The submitted time sheet is incomplete
* The time sheet doesn't represent a full week
* A staff member worked a Statutory Holiday without indicating in the description when they plan to take it later
* A statutory holiday entry contains an incorrect number of hours, is not on a Statutory Holiday, or otherwise not permitted
* An hourly staff member who is eligible for PPTO is claiming sick time (Tybalt doesn't record whether hourly staff are PPTO eligible)
* The dates of recorded work are incorrect
* The amount of work is incorrect
* The job details or description are incorrect

The above list is not exhaustive. Managers have a responsibiliy to reject time sheets as necessary to ensure accuracy and adherance to company policy.

## Rejection

If a manager elects to reject a time sheet, a dialog is shown where the manager must enter a reason. This reason must be at least 10 characters long or the rejection will not save. The submitting staff member will see the rejection and it will help them make the necessary changes. Staff members whose time sheets have been rejected must first recall the rejected time sheet and then unbundle it to make changes prior to bundling it and submitting it again. This is necessary as a rejected time sheet can never be resubmitted.
