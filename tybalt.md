## About Tybalt

Tybalt is TBT Engineering's internal software project. At the moment its major feature is a way for staff to enter time sheets and for administration to make payroll reports and invoicing reports using the structured data generated from the time sheets. The software is web-based (it works in modern web browsers), can be accessed using everyone's existing username and password (protected by MFA and optionally passwordless using the Microsoft Authenticator), and is mobile-first, meaning it's fully featured on your phone! Over time it will updated to handle more of our business processes.
